# Markdown to HTML Converter

This is a simple Rust program that converts Markdown files to HTML. It reads in a Markdown file, parses the Markdown syntax, and outputs the corresponding HTML code to a file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you'll need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. You can download Rust and Cargo from the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

### Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `cargo build` to build the project.
4. Run `cargo run` to run the program.

## Usage

To use this program, simply create a Markdown file and save it as `input.md` in the project directory. Then, run the program using the instructions in the "Installing" section. The program will read in the `input.md` file, parse the Markdown syntax, and output the corresponding HTML code to a file called `output.html`.
